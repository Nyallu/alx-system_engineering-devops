Outage Postmortem

Issue Summary

Duration: 
May 12, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 13, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: 
The messaging service experienced intermittent outages, with slow performance and missing emojis. Approximately 80% of users were affected, resulting in frustrated user experiences and a significant decrease in user engagement.

Timeline
10:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected when users started reporting missing emojis and slow response times.
10:05 AM (UTC): Customer support team escalated the issue to the engineering team.
10:10 AM (UTC): Engineers initiated investigation into the system components responsible for rendering and delivering emojis.
10:30 AM (UTC): Initial assumption made that the issue might be related to the emoji rendering service.
11:00 AM (UTC): Development team discovered that the emoji rendering service was functioning correctly and shifted focus to the messaging service itself.
12:00 PM (UTC): Database team suspected a potential database bottleneck and began analyzing query performance.
1:00 PM (UTC): Network team investigated possible network congestion issues but found no abnormalities.
2:00 PM (UTC): Incident escalated to senior management and additional resources were allocated to expedite the resolution process.
2:30 PM (UTC): Performance profiling revealed excessive resource consumption by a rogue application deployed on the same server infrastructure.
3:00 PM (UTC): The rogue application was identified and isolated, leading to a gradual restoration of service functionality.
4:00 PM (UTC): Full service recovery achieved as the isolated application was terminated.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: 
The root cause of the outage was a rogue application that was consuming an excessive amount of server resources, leading to degraded performance of the messaging service.

Resolution: 
To address the issue, the rogue application was identified and terminated, freeing up server resources and allowing the messaging service to operate at its full capacity.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Implement stricter resource allocation and monitoring mechanisms to detect and prevent rogue applications from monopolizing server resources.
Enhance system monitoring to provide real-time visibility into resource consumption and performance metrics.
Conduct regular audits to identify and remove unused or outdated applications from the server infrastructure.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of the server infrastructure to identify any additional rogue applications or resource bottlenecks.
Enhance the incident response process to ensure timely escalation and allocation of resources.
Implement proactive monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect anomalies in server resource utilization.
Develop and enforce stricter application deployment policies to prevent unauthorized or unvetted applications from being deployed in the production environment.
